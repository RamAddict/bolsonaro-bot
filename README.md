# bolsonaro-bot
Discord bolsonaro bot

Currently Bolsonaro Bot can:
- Play a video from youtube with `b.play [video name or url]` (stop with `b.stop`) (will also play from bitchute url)
- Send a thread from 4chan with  `b.chan [board]`
- Send an old quote from Bolsonaro  `b.quote`

## Major Todo: 
- googleTTS, make tts available at least in portuguese, rather than english.
- Twitter API, make bot follow bolsonaro on twitter and relay the tweets from there to a designated channel.
- Add support for 55chan, in the same way 4chan is supported.

### Minor Todo:
- *Organize code* into classes. ~~like normal people do~~
- Add bitchute video search by text on a new function like "b.bplay" (currently only link is supported).

#### Stuff may or may not do:
- Have some of the quotes be played by an audio file of the man himself.
- Make the default bot command `b.` user-changeable.
